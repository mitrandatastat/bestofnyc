# Best Schools of NYC

This repository contains a data analysis project that shows us the top 10 best high schools and top 18 most cost-effective NYC neighborhoods. It also tells us a whole lot story about the impact of wide array of demographics on the overall student performance in SAT. 

### Objectives

Below is the list of questions for the NYC region that we are looking to answer as a final outcome of this project:

* Is the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) a fair test in a diverse demographic region like New York City?

* How does the SAT score vary with race, income, gender, socioeconomic background, and wide array of other factors? 

* What are the top 10 best schools in NYC based on their average SAT score?

* Which are the least expensive NYC neighborhoods with the top 10 best schools?

* Which schools consist more than 60% of female students proportion and have an average SAT score higher than 1700?

* Which are the schools with more than 95% and less than 10% of the Hispanic students?

* Which schools have low total enrollment and have low average SAT score?


### Goal Significance

Why do we need to determine whether the SAT is a fair test or not? What advantage we could have by concluding upon the SAT test fairness with evidence? Below are the goals we can enlist: 

* This information will give us an idea about:  

	* How various factors play a role in a studentâ€™s performance in SAT?

	* How diverse the student mix within various NYC neighborhood is?

	* How effectively do different players of this game, i.e. teachers, parents, students, test system etc., contribute per their roles and responsibilities?

	* The school regions with strong/weak performances

	* Role of ethnicity, gender, income status and community environment over test performance.

* Based on the results, we can:

	* evaluate how fair the SAT system is

	* Figure out which factors need to be addressed in case of any flaw in the current system

	* Discern areas of NYC where extra attention is needed in the event of future policy amendment

### Code Explanation

Once get fork permission:

* Download - 
	
	1. *.py file 

	2. 'databank' folder
	
	3. 'nyc_property' folder
